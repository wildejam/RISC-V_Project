# RISC-V 5-Stage Model Processor

A fully implemented RISC-V processor model using the Codal/Codasip framework. See processor schematics (Schematics.pdf) for details on implementation. Two custom error-correction instructions 'enc' and 'dec' were added to this model to demonstrate the ability to add new custom instructions. Further, memory operations (store and load) have seen some functional issues during testing. Beyond this however, every instruction is fully implemented, functional, and tested.
